# TimeUI
Simple plugin, that adds HUD displaying current in-game time.
After installation, you can activate HUD with command
```
/timehud
```
Command usage requires permission "timeui"

## Known issues
- After HUD activation, you can't hide it.  
I honestly tried implementing this with no luck. If someone can fix this - PRs are appreciated.
- No support of Buuz135`s MultipleHUD.  
Maybe in future, but not in 1.0
